Static random-access memory (SRAM) is a crucial compo-
nent in modern digital systems, offering high-speed data access
and stability compared to dynamic random-access memory
(DRAM). This report discusses the design of a CMOS-based
SRAM cell, specifically a 6T configuration, which is widely
used in memory arrays. The design integrates access transistors
and cross-coupled inverters to facilitate robust data storage
and retrieval capabilities. We aim to explore the operational
characteristics of the SRAM cell through detailed circuit
analysis and simulation, highlighting its potential applications
in various computing environments.
