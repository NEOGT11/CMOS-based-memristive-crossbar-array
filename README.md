# CMOS-based-memristive-crossbar-array
This project presents the design and simulation
of a CMOS-based static random-access memory (SRAM) cell,
employing a six-transistor (6T) configuration for efficient data
storage and retrieval.


## A glance at CMOS-based-memristive-crossbar-array with tanh activation function
Static random-access memory (SRAM) is a crucial compo-
nent in modern digital systems, offering high-speed data access
and stability compared to dynamic random-access memory
(DRAM). This report discusses the design of a CMOS-based
SRAM cell, specifically a 6T configuration, which is widely
used in memory arrays. The design integrates access transistors
and cross-coupled inverters to facilitate robust data storage
and retrieval capabilities. We aim to explore the operational
characteristics of the SRAM cell through detailed circuit
analysis and simulation, highlighting its potential applications
in various computing environments.

## Future Work

1. Improved matching techniques such as Common Centroid / Interdigitisation need to be implemented while laying out the current mirror.
2. PNR for the designed circuit is yet to performed using the Open Source Tool provided by the OpenROAD project.
3. Corner Analysis Testing of the bandgap reference circuit is yet to be performed.
4. The load driving capability needs to be improved by addition of a buffer block such as an OTA or a common drain amplifier.
5. To adjust the reference voltage resistors must be trimmed using fuses, hence, resistor trimming must be employed in the circuit.
6. The design must be improved to provide a higher PSRR.
7. In the future an OTA based bandgap reference circuit will be developed with improved performance characteristics. Also, a second order bandgap reference will be studied and developed, to improve the temperature coefficient.
8. To solve the problem of unwanted parasitic BJTs being extracted due to the modification made in the Technology File.
